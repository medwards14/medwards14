## Hello!

I'm Mason, a future engineer. As a soon-to-be graduate of the University of Florida with a major in Computer Science and minors in Electrical Engineering and Physics, I am passionate about software, hardware, science, security, and data. In my free time, I like to build creative projects that allow me to learn about different areas of computing, such as the embedded software in building out a linux kernel device driver for an LED-based circuit game, or how the ARM Cortex M7 microprocessor in my Nucelo-H723ZG board manages memory. Please explore my projects, I hope you find them interesting!
